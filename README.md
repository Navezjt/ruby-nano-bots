## Setup

For a system usage:

```sh
gem install nano-bots -v 2.1.0
```

To use it in a project, add it to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'nano-bots', '~> 2.1.0'
```

```sh
bundle install
```

For credentials and configurations, relevant environment variables can be set in your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or equivalent files, as well as in your Docker Container or System Environment. Example:

### OpenAI ChatGPT

```sh
export OPENAI_API_ADDRESS=https://api.openai.com
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-access-token

export NANO_BOTS_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD=UNSAFE
export NANO_BOTS_END_USER=your-user

# export NANO_BOTS_STATE_DIRECTORY=/home/user/.local/state/nano-bots
# export NANO_BOTS_CARTRIDGES_DIRECTORY=/home/user/.local/share/nano-bots/cartridges
```

Alternatively, if your current directory has a `.env` file with the environment variables, they will be automatically loaded:

```sh
OPENAI_API_ADDRESS=https://api.openai.com
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-access-token

NANO_BOTS_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD=UNSAFE
NANO_BOTS_END_USER=your-user

```

#### Custom Project ID
If you need to manually set a Google Project ID:

```yaml
environment:
  GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

### Container

Enter the container:
```sh
docker compose run nano-bots
```

Start playing:
```sh
nb - - eval "hello"
nb - - repl

nb assistant.yml - eval "hello"
nb assistant.yml - repl
```

You can exit the REPL by typing `exit`.

## Usage

### Command Line

After installing the gem, the `nb` binary command will be available for your project or system.

Examples of usage:

```bash
nb - - eval "hello"
# => Hello! How may I assist you today?

nb to-en-us-translator.yml - eval "Salut, comment Ã§a va?"
# => Hello, how are you doing?

nb midjourney.yml - eval "happy cyberpunk robot"
# => A cheerful and fun-loving robot is dancing wildly amidst a
#    futuristic and lively cityscape. Holographic advertisements
#    and vibrant neon colors can be seen in the background.

nb lisp.yml - eval "(+ 1 2)"
# => 3

cat article.txt |
  nb to-en-us-translator.yml - eval |
  nb summarizer.yml - eval
# -> LLM stands for Large Language Model, which refers to an
#    artificial intelligence algorithm capable of processing
#    and understanding vast amounts of natural language data,
#    allowing it to generate human-like responses and perform
#    a range of language-related tasks.
```

```bash
nb - - repl

nb assistant.yml - repl
```

```text
ðŸ¤–> Hi, how are you doing?

As an AI language model, I do not experience emotions but I am functioning
well. How can I assist you?

ðŸ¤–> |
```

You can exit the REPL by typing `exit`.

All of the commands above are stateless. If you want to preserve the history of your interactions, replace the `-` with a state key:

```bash
nb assistant.yml your-user eval "Salut, comment Ã§a va?"
nb assistant.yml your-user repl

nb assistant.yml 6ea6c43c42a1c076b1e3c36fa349ac2c eval "Salut, comment Ã§a va?"
nb assistant.yml 6ea6c43c42a1c076b1e3c36fa349ac2c repl
```

You can use a simple key, such as your username, or a randomly generated one:

```ruby
require 'securerandom'

SecureRandom.hex # => 6ea6c43c42a1c076b1e3c36fa349ac2c
```

### Debugging

```sh
nb - - cartridge
nb cartridge.yml - cartridge

nb - STATE-KEY state
nb cartridge.yml STATE-KEY state
```

### Library

To use it as a library:

```ruby
require 'nano-bots/cli' # Equivalent to the `nb` command.
```

```ruby
require 'nano-bots'

NanoBot.cli # Equivalent to the `nb` command.

NanoBot.repl(cartridge: 'cartridge.yml') # Starts a new REPL.

bot = NanoBot.new(cartridge: 'cartridge.yml')

bot = NanoBot.new(
  cartridge: YAML.safe_load(File.read('cartridge.yml'), permitted_classes: [Symbol])
)

bot = NanoBot.new(
  cartridge: { ... } # Parsed Cartridge Hash
)

bot.eval('Hello')

bot.eval('Hello', as: 'eval')
bot.eval('Hello', as: 'repl')

# When stream is enabled and available:
bot.eval('Hi!') do |content, fragment, finished, meta|
  print fragment unless fragment.nil?
end

bot.repl # Starts a new REPL.

NanoBot.repl(cartridge: 'cartridge.yml', state: '6ea6c43c42a1c076b1e3c36fa349ac2c')

bot = NanoBot.new(cartridge: 'cartridge.yml', state: '6ea6c43c42a1c076b1e3c36fa349ac2c')

bot.prompt # => "ðŸ¤–\u001b[34m> \u001b[0m"

bot.boot

bot.boot(as: 'eval')
bot.boot(as: 'repl')

bot.boot do |content, fragment, finished, meta|
  print fragment unless fragment.nil?
end
```

```

#### Custom Project ID

If you need to manually set a Google Project ID:

```yaml
---
provider:
  id: google
  credentials:
    project-id: ENV/GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID
```

### Tools (Functions)

Nano Bots can also be powered by _Tools_ (Functions):

```yaml
---
tools:
  - name: random-number
    description: Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
    fennel: |
      (math.random 1 100)
```

```
ðŸ¤–> please generate a random number

random-number {} [yN] y

random-number {}
59

The randomly generated number is 59.

ðŸ¤–> |
```
To successfully use Tools (Functions), you need to specify a provider and a model that supports them. As of the writing of this README, the provider that supports them is [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models), with models `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` and `gpt-4-1106-preview`, and [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/multimodal/function-calling#supported_models), with the `vertex-ai-api` service and the model `gemini-pro`.

Check the [Nano Bots specification](https://spec.nbots.io/#/README?id=tools-functions-2) to learn more about Tools (Functions).

#### Experimental Clojure Support

We are exploring the use of [Clojure](https://clojure.org) through [Babashka](https://babashka.org), powered by [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org).

The experimental support for Clojure would be similar to Lua and Fennel, using the `clojure:` key:

```yaml
---
clojure: |
  (-> (java.time.ZonedDateTime/now)
      (.format (java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter/ofPattern "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm"))
      (clojure.string/trimr))
```

Unlike Lua and Fennel, Clojure support is not _embedded_ in this implementation. It relies on having the Babashka binary (`bb`) available in your environment where the Nano Bot is running.

Here's [how to install Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka#quickstart):

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babashka/babashka/master/install | sudo bash
```

This is a quick check to ensure that it is available and working:
```sh
bb -e '{:hello "world"}'
# => {:hello "world"}
```

We don't have sandbox support for Clojure; this means that you need to disable it to be able to run Clojure code, which you do at your own risk:

```yaml
---
safety:
  functions:
    sandboxed: false
```

### Marketplace

You can explore the Nano Bots [Marketplace](https://nbots.io) to discover new Cartridges that can help you.

## Security and Privacy

Each provider will have its own security and privacy policies (e.g. [OpenAI Policy](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies)), so you must consult them to understand their implications.

### Cryptography

By default, all states stored in your local disk are encrypted.

To ensure that the encryption is secure, you need to define a password through the `NANO_BOTS_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` environment variable. Otherwise, although the content will be encrypted, anyone would be able to decrypt it without a password.

It's important to note that the content shared with providers, despite being transmitted over secure connections (e.g., [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)), will be readable by the provider. This is because providers need to operate on the data, which would not be possible if the content was encrypted beyond HTTPS. So, the data stored locally on your system is encrypted, which does not mean that what you share with providers will not be readable by them.

To ensure that your encryption and password are configured properly, you can run the following command:
```sh
nb security
```

Which should return:
```text
âœ… Encryption is enabled and properly working.
     This means that your data is stored in an encrypted format on your disk.

âœ… A password is being used for the encrypted content.
     This means that only those who possess the password can decrypt your data.
```

Alternatively, you can check it at runtime with:
```ruby
require 'nano-bots'

NanoBot.security.check
# => { encryption: true, password: true }
```

### End-user IDs

A common strategy for deploying Nano Bots to multiple users through APIs or automations is to assign a unique [end-user ID](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids) for each user. This can be useful if any of your users violate the provider's policy due to abusive behavior. By providing the end-user ID, you can unravel that even though the activity originated from your API Key, the actions taken were not your own.

You can define custom end-user identifiers in the following way:

```ruby
NanoBot.new(environment: { NANO_BOTS_END_USER: 'custom-user-a' })
NanoBot.new(environment: { NANO_BOTS_END_USER: 'custom-user-b' })
```

Consider that you have the following end-user identifier in your environment:
```sh
NANO_BOTS_END_USER=your-name
```

Or a configuration in your Cartridge:
```yml
---
provider:
  id: openai
  settings:
    user: your-name
```

The requests will be performed as follows:

```ruby
NanoBot.new(cartridge: '-')
# { user: 'your-name' }

NanoBot.new(cartridge: '-', environment: { NANO_BOTS_END_USER: 'custom-user-a' })
# { user: 'custom-user-a' }

NanoBot.new(cartridge: '-', environment: { NANO_BOTS_END_USER: 'custom-user-b' })
# { user: 'custom-user-b' }
```

Actually, to enhance privacy, neither your user nor your users' identifiers will be shared in this way. Instead, they will be encrypted before being shared with the provider:

```ruby
'your-name'
# _O7OjYUESagb46YSeUeSfSMzoO1Yg0BZqpsAkPg4j62SeNYlgwq3kn51Ob2wmIehoA==

'custom-user-a'
# _O7OjYUESagb46YSeUeSfSMzoO1Yg0BZJgIXHCBHyADW-rn4IQr-s2RvP7vym8u5tnzYMIs=

'custom-user-b'
# _O7OjYUESagb46YSeUeSfSMzoO1Yg0BZkjUwCcsh9sVppKvYMhd2qGRvP7vym8u5tnzYMIg=
```

In this manner, you possess identifiers if required, however, their actual content can only be decrypted by you via your secure password (`NANO_BOTS_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD`).

### Decrypting

To decrypt your encrypted data, once you have properly configured your password, you can simply run:

```ruby
require 'nano-bots'

NanoBot.security.decrypt('_O7OjYUESagb46YSeUeSfSMzoO1Yg0BZqpsAkPg4j62SeNYlgwq3kn51Ob2wmIehoA==')
# your-name

NanoBot.security.decrypt('_O7OjYUESagb46YSeUeSfSMzoO1Yg0BZJgIXHCBHyADW-rn4IQr-s2RvP7vym8u5tnzYMIs=')
# custom-user-a

NanoBot.security.decrypt('_O7OjYUESagb46YSeUeSfSMzoO1Yg0BZkjUwCcsh9sVppKvYMhd2qGRvP7vym8u5tnzYMIg=')
# custom-user-b
```

If you lose your password, you lose your data. It is not possible to recover it at all. For real.

## Providers

Currently supported providers:

- [x] [Open AI ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference)
- [x] [Google Gemini](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/model-reference/gemini)
- [ ] [Anthropic Claude](https://www.anthropic.com)
- [ ] [Cohere Command](https://cohere.com)
- [ ] [Meta Llama](https://ai.meta.com/llama/)
- [ ] [01.AI Yi](https://01.ai)
- [ ] [WizardLM](https://wizardlm.github.io)
- [ ] [LMSYS Org FastChat Vicuna](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat)

Although only OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Gemini have been officially tested, some alternative providers offer APIs that are compatible with, for example, OpenAI, such as [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat#openai-compatible-restful-apis--sdk). Therefore, it is highly probable that they will work just fine.
