Start by defining a meta section:

```yaml
meta:
  symbol: ðŸ¤–
  name: Nano Bot Name
  author: Your Name
  description: A helpful assistant.
```

You can also add version and license information:

```yaml
meta:
  version: 1.0.0
  license: CC0-1.0
```

Then, add a behavior section:

```yaml
behaviors:
  interaction:
    directive: You are a helpful assistant.
```
